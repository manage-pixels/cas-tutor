<div ><p><strong>Hello all!</strong> My name is Ginger Yang. I am currently am a student in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program at Springstead High School and I am delighted to be running CASTutors for the 2021-2022 school year. Throughout my High School Career, I have tutored for a variety of subjects. I have worked with students in all sorts of subjects: Math, Reading, and History. I am familiar with all subject levels up to grade 12. Furthermore, I have worked with a multitude of people throughout my high school career, holding leadership positions in Student Council and several clubs.
I plan to work in the Government in the future so I feel this organization will broaden my knowledge and provide me with the experience I need. If you have any questions, contact our Social Media @castutors on Instagram and Facebook. I will be more than happy to discuss any comments, concerns, etc. ðŸ˜Š  </p>
