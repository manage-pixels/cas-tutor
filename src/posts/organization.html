<h5 align="center">Our Vision</h5>
<p class="feature">
  In 2020 we know the pandemic caused many students to struggle, so we created
  support through a virtual and inperson tutoring service for Hernando
  Elementary, Middle and Highschool students. We wanted to make tutoring
  accessible to everyone, so we made it free.
