<h4>How it started</h4>
 <p class="about_p">
 In September 2020, schools reopened for the 2020 to 2021 year, COVID pandemic had changed schools. For friends, Shasa, Daeja, leila and Azsti it meant uncertainty for them and their Senior
 plans and projects. While Daeja and Aszti and Leila returned to their classrooms, Shasa  remained an online student and even though they knew it would be more challenging the
 friends, still wanted to work together and contribute in their community. Drawing from their own personal experiences and observations,they zeroed
 on the pandemic's effect on students' education. They realized that students needed more support and they could help, they just needed to create a solution.

<p class="about_p">
After brainstorming, www.cascoach.com was created, the website would allow parents and students to request free peer tutoring for  Hernando County Middle
and High Schoolers. The students would be able to meet tutors online as well as onsite at Springstead HS. They could also help students gain valuable volunteer hours that could
help meet the requirements to get Bright Futures Scholarships and by working with teachers and the honor society they could work with great tutors as well.
After all their planning they marketed www.cascoach.com online and in school and in November 2020 they accepted their first request for a Tutor!

<p class="about_p">Together they created free equitable access for students tutoring and they are excited to be able to pass www.cascoach.com on to F.W. Springstead
  Junior, Ginger, to keep it going. </p>
