    <h4>How it started</h4>
    <p class="feature">
      In September 2020, schools reopened for the 2020 to 2021 year, COVID
      pandemic had changed schools. For friends, Shasa, Daeja, leila and Azsti
      it meant uncertainty for them and their Senior plans. While Daeja, Aszti
      and Leila returned to their classrooms, Shasa remained an online student
      and even though they knew it would be more challenging the friends, still
      wanted to work together. Drawing from their own personal experiences and
      observations,they zeroed in on the pandemic's effect on students'
      education. They realized that students needed more support.

      After brainstorming, www.cascoach.com was created, the website would allow
      parents and students to request free peer tutoring for Hernando County
      Middle and High Schoolers. The students would be able to meet tutors
      online as well as onsite at Springstead HS. They could also help students
      gain valuable volunteer hours that help meet the requirements for the
      Bright Futures Scholarships. The team and by worked with teachers and the
      honor society to provide great tutors as well. After all their planning
      they marketed www.cascoach.com online and in school and in November 2020
      they accepted their first request for a Tutor!
